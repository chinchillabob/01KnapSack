# 01KnapSack
The 01 knapsasck problem is described as a set of objects I which contain objects i which are an element of I.
each object i has an associated weight w_i and an associated value v_i
dynamic algos are able to solve this problem exactly in nlogn time.
The curse of dimensionality is true for this problem so as problems become more complex the need to approximate solutions is needed
here we test the dynamic algo vs a genetic algo that I wrote
